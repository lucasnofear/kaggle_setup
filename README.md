# kaggle_setup
The repo presents a easy and safe way to work with kaggle dataset in colab environment from setting up the working folder in google drive to access the API key and download dataset directly to your google drive for future access. 

## Step 1. Mount google drive to your colab environment
setup access to google drive to store dataset and access Kaggle API key

## Step 2. Store your API key downloaded from kaggle to your google drive and setup the default path to access API automatically
(refer to kaggle offical document for how to download API key https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api)

## Step 3. Download dataset using kaggle API to your project folder 
Download dataset

## Step 4. Unzip your dataset

## This is the method I came up with to efficiently setup a kaggle workenvironment in colab from safely accessing API key to download dataset for reusability.
